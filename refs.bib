  abstract = {In recent years, ransomware attacks have exploded globally, and it has become one of the most significant cyber threats to digital infrastructure. Such attacks have been targeting ranging from individuals to critical infrastructure or large organizations such as large commercial companies, energy facilities, medical centers and government departments. Ransomware attackers use sophisticated encryption techniques to hijack victims’ files in exchange for a large ransom to release encrypted data. Sophisticated encryption techniques make it almost impossible for victims to recover data without the secret key in the event of such an attack. To protect systems from ransomware threats, malicious activities had better be detected earlier, preferably before they engage in harmful behavior. Numerous studies have focused on ransomware threats and attempted to provide detection and prevention solutions for ransomware attacks, but none of the surveys explored the early detection of ransomware and highlighted challenges and issues with existing solutions. This survey fills this gap and provides a state-of-the-art overview of research on ransomware early detections. Moreover, we investigate the latest ransomware surveys and give an overview of the categories of ransomware from different perspectives, the evolution and attack process of ransomware, and provide datasets used for ransomware detection. Finally, the possible future research directions are discussed.}

  abstract = {In recent years, ransomware attacks have attracted the attention of researchers and companies, prompting new issues in identifying effective defense techniques. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of ransomware attacks and their employed tactics from 2020 to 2024, leveraging a large dataset of over 16,000 documented ransomware incidents involving 155 distinct gangs. Using this data, we identify the exploited software vulnerabilities (CVEs) and map them to specific adversarial behaviors within the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In addition to this technical mapping, we differentiated between broadly targeting “generalist” gangs and industry-focused ”specialist” gangs, and we examined variations in attack patterns across target sectors and geographic origins. Our methodology reveals the core ”ransomware blueprint”: a unified kill-chain model comprising recurring techniques spanning initial access through encryption. Key findings include the use of high-severity, widely deployed CVEs (particularly public-facing exploits, such as T1190) as entry points, followed by routine privilege escalation, lateral movement, and impact actions (e.g., T1486 for data encryption). The analysis also reveals regional and sectoral differences: (i) Russian-origin groups often emphasize rapid disruption and recovery inhibition, and (ii) other groups focus on stealthier reconnaissance. Generalist gangs (e.g., LockBit, Cl0p, ALPHV) employ advanced techniques across multiple industries, while specialist gangs concentrate on narrower sectors, using simpler methods such as phishing and credential reuse. Moreover, the number of shared techniques is employed to assess the degree of interconnection among the gangs. These findings provide actionable intelligence for defenders, highlighting the need for multi-layered defenses, targeted vulnerability management, and sector-specific hardening strategies to mitigate evolving ransomware threats.}

  abstract   = {The expanding realm of digital nudging presents significant challenges for current research, due to its growing volume and diversity. This necessitates a unified framework for understanding and integrating the vast literature. In response, our study introduces a comprehensive taxonomy of digital nudging, developed through the analysis of 88 peer-reviewed publications. Our four-dimensional taxonomy includes five contexts, ten forms, two levels of intrusiveness, and three levels of user impact. This taxonomy serves as a foundational tool for coherent understanding, enabling the categorization, comparison, and synthesis of diverse studies. We also provide a consistent and precise definition of digital nudging, resolving semantic ambiguities and further clarifying the field. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research directions in digital nudging and offer practical guidelines for practitioners implementing nudges across various domains.},

  abstract  = {Cache side-channel attacks have been extensively studied on x86 architectures, but much less so on ARM processors. The technical challenges to conduct side-channel attacks on ARM, presumably, stem from the poorly documented ARM cache implementations, such as cache coherence protocols and cache flush operations, and also the lack of understanding of how different cache implementations will affect side-channel attacks. This paper presents a systematic exploration of vectors for flush-reload attacks on ARM processors. flush-reload attacks are among the most well-known cache side-channel attacks on x86. It has been shown in previous work that they are capable of exfiltrating sensitive information with high fidelity. We demonstrate in this work a novel construction of flush-reload side channels on last-level caches of ARM processors, which, particularly, exploits return-oriented programming techniques to reload instructions. We also demonstrate several attacks on Android OS (e.g., detecting hardware events and tracing software execution paths) to highlight the implications of such attacks for Android devices.},
